# Recording length needed to achieve robust statistical effects in neurophysiology 

This GitHub repo contains code for i) simulating neural time series based on [NeuroDSP](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/)  and ii) testing the data duration needed to observe stable statitical between-groups effect.


# Information

Code for simulating time series contained in folder [Simulations](../MegTakesTime/Simulations). This code relies on the [NeuroDSP toolbox](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/). We simulate participants from two cohorts using input spectral parameters (e.g., aperiodic slope, alpha peak frequency) taken from a normal distribution. We parametrically manipulate the disrtibution of a single sopectral parameetrr across a group such that we end up with nine simulations (three effect sizes and three spectral parameters). 

Please see the methods XXXX for details.
