# Recording length needed to achieve robust statistical effects in neurophysiology 

This GitHub repo contains code for i) simulating neural time series and ii) testing the data duration needed to observe stable statitical between-groups effect.


# Information

Code for simulating time series contained in folder XXXX. This code relies on the NeuroDSP toolbox. We simulate participants from two cohorts using input spectral parameters (e.g., aperiodic slope, alpha peak frequency) taken from a normal distribution. We parametrically manipulate the disrtibution of a single sopectral parameetrr across a group such that we end up with nine simulations (three effect sizes and three spectral parameters). 

Please see the methods XXXX for details.
